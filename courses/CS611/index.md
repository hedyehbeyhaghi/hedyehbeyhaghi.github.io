# COMPSCI 611 - Advanced Algorithms
Welcome to the Fall 2025 course webpage for **COMPSCI 611 - Advanced Algorithms**.

## Course Information
- **Instructor:** [Hedyeh Beyhaghi](https://hedyehbeyhaghi.github.io)
- **TAs:** Fatemeh Ghaffari, Purna Dutta, Shuang Yang
- **Class Time:** Mondays and Wednesdays, 2:30 PM - 3:45 PM
- **Location:** Goessmann Laboratory room 20
- **Slides:** Slides will be posted on Canvas.

## Textbooks

### Primary Resource:
- **Slides and lecture notes** available on Canvas.

### Additional References:
- *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
- *Algorithm Design* by Kleinberg and Tardos.
- *Algorithms* by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
- [Jeff Erickson’s Algorithms Textbook](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms)

### Specific Topics in More Detail:
- *Randomized Algorithms* by Motwani and Raghavan.
- *Probability and Computing* by Mitzenmacher and Upfal.
- *Approximation Algorithms* by Vazirani.

## Assessment

- **Homework (25% of grade):** Around **5 biweekly assignments**. 
- **Quizzes (15% of grade):** Weekly **online quizzes**. 
- **Exams (55% of grade):**  
  - **Midterm (25%)**
  - **Final Exam (30%)**   
- **Participation (5% of grade):** Based on **forum participation**, i.e., asking good questions and helping other students on Piazza.

### Late Policy:
- **No late quizzes** allowed, but the lowest quiz score will be dropped.
- **Homework late days:** Each student has up to **4 late days** for the semester.
  - You **cannot use more than 2 late days per assignment**.
  - Late days must be used in **integer increments** (1 or 2 days).
  - **Beyond this policy, no late submissions will be accepted.**
 
## Honesty and Collaboration Policy

Violating any of the following rules **risks an automatic F**. Ask if you're unsure about any of the policies.

- **Homework:** Collaborating with at most three other students on homework is allowed, and you must mention who you worked with. Each student must write their solutions independently. You are **not allowed** to use material from the web (or any material except that listed on the course page) or discuss the homework with anyone outside your collaboration group (aside from the instructor or TA).
- **Quizzes:** No collaboration is allowed! However, you can consult course material.
- **Exams:** Exams are **closed-book** and **no collaboration is allowed**.
- **AI Tools:** The use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) is **strictly prohibited** for solving homework, quizzes, or exams.
